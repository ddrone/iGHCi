# iGHCi

This is an experimental tool that wraps GHCi REPL and adds file watching on top of that. When loaded file is changed, REPL automatically reloads it and recomputes every previously entered expression and shows the results.

If you want to see it in action, check out [this 30-seconds video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNhoAxABzmM).

## Running

[Stack](https://haskellstack.org) is used for building and running the code.

## Project status

Rough prototype. All sorts of things are broken, the purpose is mostly to demonstrate the idea.

## Contributing

Probably don't bother with pull requests, but issues, feature requests and general feedback are very welcome.
